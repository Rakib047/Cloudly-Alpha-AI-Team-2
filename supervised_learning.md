# Supervised Learning Part-1

A type of machine learning that learns from given examples. The model takes the examples as input x, and their corresponding labels as y. The model uses a learning algorithm to learn from these x and y pairs so that, it can generate close to accurate y outputs for an input x that was never seen by the model before.

Regression and Classification are two major types of supervised learning algorithms.
